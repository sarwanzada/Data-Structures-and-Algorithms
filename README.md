# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations and practice problems for **Data Structures and Algorithms** in different programming languages.  
It is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation for **competitive programming**, **technical interviews**, and **computer science fundamentals**.
